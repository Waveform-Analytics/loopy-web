A modern, fully functional CGM dashboard built with React, TypeScript, and D3.js.

## ðŸŽ¯ PROJECT STATUS: COMPLETE âœ…

**All Implementation Steps Finished:**

**Step 1-4: Foundation âœ…**
- âœ… React TypeScript project with all dependencies
- âœ… Complete type system (CGM, Chart, Pump, Common types)
- âœ… Robust API service layer with retry logic and error handling
- âœ… Advanced React hooks for state management and D3 interactions

**Step 5: Time Range Selector âœ…**
- âœ… Interactive time range buttons (1h, 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h)
- âœ… Live mode toggle with countdown timer
- âœ… Manual refresh controls with loading states
- âœ… Mobile-responsive design

**Step 6: D3.js Chart Component âœ…**
- âœ… Smooth pan/zoom interactions with D3.js transforms
- âœ… Auto-scaling Y-axis based on visible data vs user interaction
- âœ… Interactive tooltips with data point information
- âœ… Target range visualization with customizable thresholds
- âœ… Loading/error states with Material-UI components

**Step 7: Dashboard Layout âœ…**
- âœ… Complete responsive dashboard with current reading + chart
- âœ… Real-time glucose monitoring with alert notifications
- âœ… Mobile-optimized design (current reading in header)
- âœ… Snackbar notifications for glucose alerts
- âœ… Material-UI theming and styling integration

## ðŸš€ LIVE APPLICATION

**Currently Running:** http://localhost:3000

**Features Working:**
- Interactive D3.js chart with smooth pan/zoom
- Current glucose reading with trend arrows and status indicators
- Time range selector with live mode
- Real-time data updates every 5 minutes
- Glucose alert notifications
- Professional Material-UI styling
- Full mobile responsiveness

## Installed Dependencies

- **React 19** + TypeScript
- **Material-UI 7** for components and theming
- **D3.js 7** for interactive charts
- **Axios** for API communication  
- **date-fns** for time utilities

## Architecture Principles

- **Separation of concerns**: Data, state, and UI layers clearly separated
- **TypeScript first**: Strong typing throughout
- **D3.js best practices**: Full data scales + transform-based interactions
- **Extensible design**: Ready for pump data integration
- **Mobile responsive**: Touch-friendly interactions

## Environment

API configured for:
- Backend: https://loopy-api-production.up.railway.app
- Authentication: Bearer token configured in .env

## Development Commands

```bash
npm start    # Start development server
npm build    # Build for production  
npm test     # Run tests
```

## Testing Services

To test the API connection, you can:

1. **In browser console** (when dev server is running):
   ```javascript
   // Available after importing ServiceTest component
   testServices.quickTest()
   testServices.runAllTests()
   ```

2. **Use the ServiceTest component**:
   ```typescript
   // Temporarily add to App.tsx:
   import { ServiceTest } from './ServiceTest';
   ```

3. **Test endpoints directly**:
   - Health: https://loopy-api-production.up.railway.app/api/health
   - Current: https://loopy-api-production.up.railway.app/api/cgm/current
